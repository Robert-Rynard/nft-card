## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was the first project that I worked on without a guide or tutorial and showed me how important it is to practice these skills outside of learning them. There were lots of things that I take for granted that I struggled with in implementing this. This project helped me better understand how to implement the css I have learned as well as use properties I'm not used to.

### Continued development

Going forward I would like to learn more about how flex positioning works and the best practices for using it vs grid. Another topic I struggled with in this project was orginization. I tried to stay orginized but the further I got in the project the less orginized my project became. Completing this project helped me get a bigger picture of the whole when implementing and will help me to better stay orginized in my future projects.
